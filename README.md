# Fault-Diagnosis-of-a-Rotating-Machinery
The objective of this project is to showcase how the performance of a multi-sensor system can be improved by reducing uncertainty, improving robustness and reliability by deploying statistical decision-making tools like Bayesian estimation. The project has been split into two parts, The first part deals with the problem of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of a rotary machine by extracting features from a set of vibration signals, and then classify them into different clusters using KNN algorithm. The second part deals with multisensor signal estimation using different Bayesian estimators.
